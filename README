    <h1>Game Description</h1>
    <p>By: Rayaan Arif</p>

    <h2>Here's a breakdown of the game:</h2>

    <h3>Objective:</h3>
    <p>The player's goal is to shoot falling enemy ships using a gunner ship.</p>

    <h3>Gameplay:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The player controls a gunner ship located at the bottom center of the screen, which can be moved horizontally with mouse or touch input.</li>
        <li>The gunner ship is visually represented with a diamond-like image, appear from the top and descend.</li>
        <li>Firing bullets by clicking or touching the screen allows the player to hit these enemy ships.</li>
        <li>Each successful hit increases the player's score by 10.</li>
        <li>The game starts with 3 lives. A life is lost if an enemy ship reaches the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>The game ends when all lives are depleted, displaying a "Game Over" message and the final score.</li>
        <li>Players can restart the game at any time using a dedicated button.</li>
        <li>The difficulty increases over time, with circles falling faster and spawning more frequently.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Visuals & Sound:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A darkened full-screen background video creates the atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Custom Base64 encoded images are used for the gun and the diamond-like gunner ship.</li>
        <li>The game includes sound effects for shooting, hitting circles, and a game over state.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Technology:</h3>
    <p>The game is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring dynamic element creation and event handling for a responsive user experience across devices.</p>

    <h3>Updates:</h3>
    <p>I plan to add a UI with many levels like this index.html file but with designs & shapes.</p>
